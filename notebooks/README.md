## ALF-T5 Training Notebooks

The notebooks on this folder can be used to train the model on two main bases: **T5-Base** (recommended) and **T5-Large** (best results).

You can either run it locally or using **Google Collab**, it shouldn't take long to train, but the better the hardware, the faster it will be.
