## CoAL-1 Training Notebooks

The notebooks on this folder can be used to train the model on three main bases: **T5-Base** (recommended), **T5-Large** (best results) & **Llama** (experimental).

You can either run it locally or using **Google Collab**, it shouldn't take long to train, but the better the hardware, the faster it will be.
